        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>- Mistford and Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife pReserve are struggling with endangerment of Rose-Crested Blue Pipit</p>
        <p>- Kasios Office Furniture, an 'eco friendly' company, has been implicated as a cause in their endangerment</p>
        <p>- Mitch Vogel has traveled to Europe to investigate Methylosmoline damage at a Norther European aviary</p>
        <p>- He is suspicious that EuroKasios is the cause</p>
        <p>- He receives an anonymous letter from a Kasios employee containing 2.5 years of data regarding company interaction</p>
        <p>- A Kasios International leader has learned that AGOC-3A is not as effective as Methylosmoline</p>
        <p>- He feels pressure to restart Methylosmoline production</p>
        <p>- He amasses a small group to secretly buy this, and soon a larger group forms around the purchases</p>
